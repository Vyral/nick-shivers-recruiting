<p>Dear Real Estate Agent, </p>

<p>I understand that you may be working at a real estate brokerage or on a traditional team as part of someone else’s personal brand. You understand your potential and are working hard to clear a path toward your goals, but currently lack the support you need to achieve them. </p>

<p>More than that, you may be feeling as though your current brokerage doesn’t share the core values that drew you to this industry in the first place. For newer agents, especially, this can be quite discouraging. </p>

<p>Many brokerages claim to be centered around helping the community but fail to make good on their word once they’ve drawn you in. They may also offer false promises about the kind of structure, coaching, and resources they provide. As a result of this and other factors, <strong>87% of all new agents fail within five years of working in the industry.</strong></p>

<p>But don’t let this scare you. If you truly want to make a difference, serve the people in your community, and support yourself and your family through a fulfilling career, you can still do so. All you need is a change of scenery. After all, even the most hardworking agent won’t get anywhere if they aren’t headed in the right direction. </p>

<p>It’s time to stop chasing dead ends. It’s time to forge your own path to success and to start making a difference. </p>

<p><strong>My name is Nick Shivers. I’m the broker of The Nick Shivers Team and I’ve got an offer for you.</strong> Having worked in real estate for the last two decades, I’ve seen a lot of people in the same position you’re in right now. My team and I operate on a set of core values centered around truly helping people. And we want to help you, too.</p>

<p>I’ve seen far too many new agents bury themselves in debt just trying to find a way to jumpstart their business. They invest all their time, money, and energy into dead-end resources that won’t actually help their career. Of course, I don’t blame these agents for not knowing where to start. Almost every Realtor in the industry has, at some point, laid awake wondering how they’re going to make things work—wondering whether they’ve made the right choice by entering this industry to begin with. </p>

<p>If this sounds familiar, consider this message your lifeline. During my time in the real estate industry, I’ve built and implemented proven systems that agents of all experience levels can plug into and succeed. Whether you’ve been in this business for a month or a year, these systems will give you the guidance, structure, and accountability you need to thrive. Our team runs smoothly thanks to our shared passion for generosity and helpfulness. Each person on The Nick Shivers Team genuinely cares about the people we serve, and also about the other people on our team. Because of this, no other brokerage in Oregon has sold as many houses as we have. </p>

<p>The Nick Shivers Team truly invests in its agents’ success. We offer:
<ul class="indent">
<li>Expert coaching for every approach to prospecting and conversion</li>
<li>High-level training and guidance</li>
<li>Proven systems for agent success</li>
<li>A sense of community</li>
<li>The opportunity to connect with clients through our “Sell a Home, Save a Child” program</li>
<li>Leads</li>
<li>And much more</li>
</ul></p>

<p>When you join us, your path to success starts right away with our 90-day onboarding system. We are so confident in these systems that we guarantee you’ll make at least $75,000 in your first year, so long as you follow them correctly. </p>

<p>Our support-oriented environment helps professionals learn, grow, and thrive. <strong>People join our team because they want to succeed, make money, and serve our community.</strong> We understand that to reach those goals, you need support, coaching, resources, and leads—so that is exactly what we provide.</p>

<p>As strongly as I believe in what our team can offer you, though, you don’t just have to take my word for it. Consider the success story of one of our current agents: Rich Ovitt</p>

<p>Before joining our team, Rich was actually one of our clients. At the time, he was working at a medical bed company. He wasn’t happy about his hours, or about his career, in general, so I asked him to sit down with me for a conversation about potentially getting into real estate. Suffice to say, it worked out. Within his first year on our team, Rich was able to sell 71 homes—something many agents never do, even with years of experience under their belt. </p>

<p>And then there’s Amy—another past-client-turned-agent on our team. Amy, a former stay-at-home-mom, found herself in dire straits when her husband left. She knew she needed to find a job quickly, and that’s when I suggested she join our team. Amy agreed, got her license, and went on to close 28 transactions in her first year. A little while after that, she, much like Rich, began outperforming Realtors with other brokerages who have been in the industry for more than a decade. </p>

<p>These success stories are incredible, and now it’s time for you to start writing your own. </p>

<p>The choice is in your hands. You can stay struggling where you’re at, join a big box brokerage where you’ll get no support, or even quit the industry altogether and go get started working at a 9-to-5 job—or you can join The Nick Shivers Team and start leading the life you deserve. <strong>We’re looking for a select group of smart, compassionate, full-time agents to join us, and that could very well include you.</strong> </p>

<p>So why wait? The chance to change your life and career for the better is right in front of you. </p>

<p>But, with as much focus as we devote to each agent, we can only hire so many new people each year. This means you’ll need to respond quickly if you want to be among them. Don’t pass up this opportunity. Call us now, and see what a career with The Nick Shivers Team can do for you. The longer you wait to reach out, the longer you’re suppressing your true potential. Let’s have a conversation. </p>

<p>I look forward to talking with you soon!</p>
